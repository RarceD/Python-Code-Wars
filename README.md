This is just a learnign curve of python:

 - First make a not shameless game.
 - Graphical user interface with App.

 - Brain fuck compiler.

Not very ambitious,

- Game -> A **platform game** for getting start

### Face Detection
- Face_detection_game -> Control the previous game with your face
### Genetic Algorithm
- Genetic_algorithm -> Dot following another dot
- Pole balancing
