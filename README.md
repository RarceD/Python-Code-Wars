## STATUS NOTE ##

This is just a learnign curve of python:

 - First make a not shameless game.
 - Graphical user interface with App.
 - Gegetic Algorithm to control the game.
 - Brain fuck compiler.

Not very ambitious, 

## Getting Started ##
### Game
- Game -> A **platform game** for getting start

### Face Detection
- Face_detection_game -> Control the previous game with your face
### Genetic Algorithm
- Genetic_algorithm -> Dot following another dot
